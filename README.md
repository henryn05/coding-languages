# Pokedex Project

## Who
This project is created for my potential employers and professional network.

## What
A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an
external API.

## When
Always and immediately. The code for this pokedex app can always be viewed in a repository.

## Where
The app can be viewed directly from my GitHub repository or be directed to my GitHub profile via my portfolio website or here too: https://henryn05.github.io/pokedex/

## Why
I made this app to develop and showcase my ability to create a small JavaScript application using an external API and the Bootstrap framework.
