# Pokedex Project

## Who
This project is created for my potential employers and professional network.

## What
A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an
external API.

## When
Always and immediately. The code for my pokedex app can always be viewed in a repository.

## Where
Potential employers, clients, and collaborators may look at the code either directly from my GitHub repository or be directed to my GitHub profile via my portfolio website.

## Why
For possible employers, clients, and collaborators to see my ability to create a small JavaScript application using an external API and the Bootstrap framework.
